# ShareMaster Persistent Text Content

https://sharemaster.io

## Summary

The ShareMaster Persistent Text Content feature enables the creation of text elements within SharePoint that are stored in a SharePoint list. This functionality ensures that when you design SharePoint templates and duplicate the site page containing these elements, the original content remains unaffected. Consequently, it facilitates the development and modification of templates, allowing for the distribution of updates to client pages without altering their customized sections.
